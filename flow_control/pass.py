# Python pass Statement

# In Python programming, the pass statement is a null statement which can be used as a placeholder for future code.

# Suppose we have a loop or a function that is not implemented yet, but we want to implement it in the future. In such cases
# , we can use the pass statement.



# Using pass With Conditional Statement
n = 10

# use pass inside if statement
if n > 10:
    pass

print('Hello')
